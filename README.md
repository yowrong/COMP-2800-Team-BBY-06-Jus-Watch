## General Info
Just Watch is a web/mobile application platform that will be used to connect friends and groups of people through watching movies. It will act as a hub similar to a movie club, and will allow users to nominate and vote for movies that they as a group would like to watch.  Users can also post reviews and comments to their groupâ€™s page to facilitate discussion of the movie after watching.
